<!-- This is the configuration file for the resource manager in Hadoop. -->
<!-- You can configure various scheduling parameters related to queues. -->
<!-- The properties for a queue follow a naming convention,such as, -->
<!-- mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.<queue-name>.property-name. -->

<configuration xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">


  <property>
    <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.capacity</name>
    <value>100</value>
    <description>Percentage of the number of slots in the cluster that are
      guaranteed to be available for jobs in this queue.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.supports-priority</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>If true, priorities of jobs will be taken into
      account in scheduling decisions.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.minimum-user-limit-percent</name>
    <value>100</value>
    <description> Each queue enforces a limit on the percentage of resources
    allocated to a user at any given time, if there is competition for them.
    This user limit can vary between a minimum and maximum value. The former
    depends on the number of users who have submitted jobs, and the latter is
    set to this property value. For example, suppose the value of this
    property is 25. If two users have submitted jobs to a queue, no single
    user can use more than 50% of the queue resources. If a third user submits
    a job, no single user can use more than 33% of the queue resources. With 4
    or more users, no user can use more than 25% of the queue's resources. A
    value of 100 implies no user limits are imposed.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.default.maximum-initialized-jobs-per-user</name>
    <value>25</value>
    <description>The maximum number of jobs to be pre-initialized for a user
    of the job queue.
    </description>
  </property>
